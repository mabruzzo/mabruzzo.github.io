## About Me

I'm a postdoc at the University of Pittsburgh. For my research, I employ numerical simulations to investigate galactic evolution and properties of the circumgalactic medium.

I am also involved in the development of scientific software.
In particular, I am one of the primary developers of the [Enzo-E](https://github.com/enzo-project/enzo-e) (magneto)hydrodynamics AMR code and an active developer of the [Cholla](https://github.com/cholla-hydro/cholla) (magneto)hydrodynamics GPU code. Additionally, I am co-manager of the [Grackle](https://github.com/grackle-project/grackle) chemistry and radiative cooling library and I was one of the original developers of the stellar spectral synthesis code, [Korg.jl](https://github.com/ajwheeler/Korg.jl).
