## About Me

I'm a sixth year astronomy PhD candidate at Columbia University and my advisor is [Greg Bryan](https://www.astro.columbia.edu/profile?uid=gbryan).
For my research, I employ numerical simulations to investigate galactic evolution and properties of the circumgalactic medium.
I am also interested the development of hydrodynamical codes and am a contributor to the hydrodynamics code [Enzo-E](https://github.com/enzo-project/enzo-e).
